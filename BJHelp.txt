INSTRUCTIONS:


This game is based on the Blackjack card game, where the
objective is to beat the dealer by acquiring cards that total
higher than the dealer's cards without going over 21. In this
version, the player and dealer are each dealt an initial card. The
player is then prompted to draw additional cards. The player
may draw as many additional cards as desired, as long as the
player's hand adds up to less than 21. If the player's hand goes
over 21, the player busts and the dealer automatically
wins. Once the player decides to hold, it is the dealer's
turn. The dealer continues to add new cards to his hand
until it adds up to 17 or more or the dealer busts. Once the
dealer's hand is complete, the game analyzes the player's hand
and the dealer's hand to determine the results of the game.
