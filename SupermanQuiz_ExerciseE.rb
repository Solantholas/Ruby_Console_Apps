# Script Name: SupermanQuiz.rb
# Version:     1.1
# Author:      Corey Hicks
# Date:        21 Jan 2018
#
# Description: This Ruby script demonstrates how to work with loops when
#              collecting user input through the creation of an
#              interactive quiz that evaluates the playerï¿½s knowledge of
#              the Superman movie series.
#
#      This program contains 2 pre-defined classes and methods to accomplish
# this task. First, a Screen class and methods are created, just like the
# TypingChallenge. Second, the Quiz class is created with 6 defined methods:
# display_greeting, display_instructions, disp_scale, disp_q, determine_grade,
# and Display Credits. All 4 of the display methods only serve the purpose of
# displaying string values to the user. However, display_instructions includes
# the only method call for disp_scale after extracting user input.
# Determine_grade uses an if/else statement to determine if the user correctly
# answered 6 or more questions and displays string values to the user.
# Display_credits simply displays string values to the user.
#
#     This week was strongly focused on loop manipulation. Within the main body
# of the code, I implemented an inner and outer loop to handle the replay
# constraints. A do loop is implemented before the quiz begins. After the quiz
# is finished, the program calculates teh total number of questions answered
# correctly by the user. If the user answers 6 or more questions correctly, the
# do loop is broken. However, if the user fails to answer 6 questions an inner
# do loop is initialized to ask prompt the user to retry the quiz before breaking.
# Finally, an if/else statement is used to determine the user input and either
# break or repeat the outer loop.
